✦ Caesar Cipher – Cybersecurity Task 1

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

Task Objective-

Cybersecurity Internship – Task 1:  
Build a Caesar Cipher in Python that can encrypt and decrypt text based on a user-defined shift.

How It Works-

- The user selects whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.  
- A text input and a shift value are taken from the user.  
- Each letter in the message is shifted by the defined number of places.  
- Non-alphabet characters are preserved.

Sample Output:

```bash
Type 'e' to encrypt or 'd' to decrypt: e  
Enter your message: hello world  
Enter shift value: 3  
Encrypted Message: khoor zruog
